This app is very simple. The page contains an input form as well as several buttons containing different reactions. Upon pressing a reaction button, the site will display 10 images pulled from GIPHY. When the images are clicked, they play the gif version of the still image. 

The user can use the input form to add new buttons, which will function the same.
